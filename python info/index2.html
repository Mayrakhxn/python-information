        <h2>What is Python?</h2>
        <p>Python is a high-level interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.</p>

        <p class="point">1. High-Level Language:</p>
        <p>Python is a high-level programming language, which means it provides a high level of abstraction from the hardware. This makes it easier to write and understand code.</p>

        <p class="point">2. Interpreted Language:</p>
        <p>Python is an interpreted language, which means you don't need to compile your code before running it. The Python interpreter reads and executes the code line by line.</p>

        <p class="point">3. General-Purpose Language:</p>
        <p>Python is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, automation, and more.</p>

        <p class="point">4. Readability:</p>
        <p>Python emphasizes code readability with its clear and easy-to-understand syntax. It uses indentation (whitespace) to define code blocks, making the code visually clean.</p>

        <p class="point">5. Dynamic Typing:</p>
        <p>Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare variable types explicitly. The interpreter determines the data type of a variable during runtime.</p>

        <p class="point">6. Large Standard Library:</p>
        <p>Python comes with a vast standard library that includes modules and packages for various tasks. This library helps developers avoid reinventing the wheel and speeds up development.</p>

        <p class="point">7. Community and Ecosystem:</p>
        <p>Python has a large and active community of developers, which means there are plenty of resources, libraries, and frameworks available for various purposes. Popular libraries include NumPy, pandas, Django, and TensorFlow.</p>

        <p class="point">8. Cross-Platform:</p>
        <p>Python is cross-platform, meaning you can write code on one platform (e.g., Windows) and run it on another (e.g., macOS or Linux) without modification.</p>

        <p class="point">9. Object-Oriented:</p>
        <p>Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, allowing developers to create and use classes and objects.</p>

        <p class="point">10. Open Source:</p>
        <p>Python is open-source software, and its interpreter is available for free. This encourages collaboration and the development of third-party packages and tools.</p>
